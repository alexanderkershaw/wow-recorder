## Tips
- Rename your output columns so you donâ€™t get confused on which is which. Just right click the area circled. VAIO is your nonfiltered audio and AUX is the filtered discord audio.

- You can have multiple audio outputs for different speaker/headset configs by selecting them in the A1 A2 A3 in the top right. Put your secondary setup on A2 and then whenever you want to swap from headset to speaker or whatever you have setup select them.
