Warcraft Recorder is a desktop screen recorder. It watches the WoW combat log file for interesting events, records them, and presents a user interface in which the recordings can be viewed.

Windows is currently the only supported operating system. 

#  How to Use
1. Download and run the most recent installer from the [releases](https://github.com/aza547/wow-recorder/releases) section.
1. Launch the application and click the settings cog, then fill out the settings page.
1. Edit the Scene tab to select your resolution.
1. Enable **advanced** combat logging.
    - Retail: Install and configure the SimpleCombatLogger addon ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simplecombatlogger), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/simplecombatlogger)).
    - Classic: Install and configure the AutoCombatLogger addon ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/autocombatlogger), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/autocombatlogger)). 

If you are a retail arena player, I also recommend the [jaxSurrender](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/jaxsurrender) addon.

# Testing It Works

# Mentions

The recording done by Warcraft Recorder is made possible by packaging up [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). We wouldn't stand a chance at providing something useful without it. Big thanks to the OBS developers.

This application is also heavily reliant on [OBS Studio Node](https://github.com/stream-labs/obs-studio-node) to provide bindings to libOBS. Special mention for the folks over at [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/) for open-sourcing the project. 

The app is built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/), using the boilerplate provided by the [ERB](https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/) project.
